2 - Set a variable called total to 0. Your programme should ask the user to enter five numbers and
after each input, ask them if they want that number to be included. If they do, the programme
should then add the number to the total. If they do not want it included, the programme shouldnâ€™t
add the number to the total. After the user has entered all five numbers, display the total.
